# Promote Workshop

The goal of promoting the workshop is to:
1. Invite students who are underrepresented in tech
2. Invite more mentors


## Create Event

1. Meetup

Advantage: broad variety of audiences


2. BridgeTroll

Advantage: BridgeTroll will send out a notification to everyone who has participated in any bridge events before. You will be able to reach out to people who are interested/ familiar with bridge events.
It has really good organization tools for you to collect student info and to send notification emails.

Disadvantage: challenging to reach out to people who are not aware of/ has never participated in any bridge events.


3. Eventbrite

Advantage: good organization tool


## What tools/platforms should you use to promote?
Know your audiences is the first step. Then promote on the platform where they are active.
ScalaBridge workshop's audiences are:
1. people who are not already in the community (students)
2. people who are in the community (mentors)


## How to promote to students?
1. Meetup groups

I found local meetup groups are great platforms for spreading the words. You can post the event registration link to the meetup group discussion. It is even better if you can send a notification email to everyone on the email list.

2. Email list of different groups

Send emails to email lists 
find target audiences
