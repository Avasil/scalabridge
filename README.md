# ScalaBridge Workshop

ScalaBridge workshop is intended to reach out to all underrepresented populations who are interested in learning Scala.

**Note: You do not have to be a woman to be underrepresented in tech. Diversity comes in many forms: race, gender, age, religion, culture, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, etc. If at any point, you feel excluded from any ScalaBridge event, please do not hesisate to reach out to me [@yifan_xing_e](https://twitter.com/yifan_xing_e).**


## What is a ScalaBridge workshop?
ScalaBridge workshops are usually one-day long events, which will take students through the basics of functional programming in Scala using Creative Scala tutorial. By the end of the workshop, students will have built several doodles using Creative Scala, have a basic understanding of functional programming, and a grasp of Scala fundamentals.
